Description: The LULU algorithm excludes artefactual OTUs without discarding
    rare, but real OTUs. The core mechanism is the identification and merging
    of ‘daughter’ OTUs with consistently co-occurring, sequence-similar, but 
    more abundant ‘parent’ OTUs across a multi-sample dataset, under the 
    assumption that the ‘daughter’ OTUs are artefacts. The algorithm is 
    independent of a reference database, and can thus be applied to any OTU 
    table produced for any set of samples with any initial OTU definition 
    algorithm.
